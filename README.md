<h1 align="center">Caesar Cipher</h1>

I was tasked to create a Caesar Cipher in my class, "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" by Dr. Angela Wu. I am taking this Udemy class on the side of my official coursework at Western Governors University. This is day eight of the class. I took a break to complete my C170 Data Management - Applications class.

A Caesar Cipher is the simplest form of encryption. It takes a message and shift amount. The message is shifted alphabetically either ascending or descending depending on if you are encrypting or decrypting.

<h2>I was to focus on using the following concepts that I learned today.</h2>

-Defining functions

-Function parameters and arguments

-Reinforcement of for loops and if statements

<h2>What I learned</h2>
Honestly, this was challenging for me and right now I am pretty burnt out.. I ultimately learned a very valuable lesson at this stage of my education. Go down the rabbit hole a bit but not for too long. Come up, take a breath, and see how it is done. Not doing so only leads to frustration that will be detrimental to educational discipline. Somebody has done what you are trying to do and with probably 80% less code. Using functions wasn't anything new or challenging to me. The reinforcement of using for loops to iterate through lists was very good to have. The last block of code determines whether or not the user would like to repeat the program. That was at the end of my struggles and I pretty much Stack Overflowed it. Not proud, but it will be a useful statement to use in my future.

<h2>Issues I had and where I can do better.</h2>
Like I addressed above I went in too deep and made things way to complicated. My saving graces were Stack Overflow and my professor's solutions. Ultimately a hybrid of my code, SO, and my professor came to be.
